# SimpleVanillaJsToDo

This a simple project using only Vanilla Javascript where i created, manipulated, and inyected elements to the DOM
using only Javascript functionalities.

This project took me around an hour and a half to create because i was playing around with different properties
and different methods to manipulate the elements using JS (no HTML and no CSS).

Then i realized that i needed to learn about GIT Fundamentals and GitHub to work with remote repositories for
my personal projects and hopefully in a company as a web developer.

I learned about Git commands (init, branching, merge, and a bunch of usefull commands) and how to link all the
work to my personal remote repositories using GitHub.
